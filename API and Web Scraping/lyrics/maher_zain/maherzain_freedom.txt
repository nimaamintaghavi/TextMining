Gathered here with my family
...My neighbours and my friends
Standing firm together against oppression holding hands
It doesn't matter where you're from
Or if you're young, old, women or man
We're here for the same reason; we want to take back our land

Oh God thank you..
For giving us the strength to hold on
And now we're here together

Calling you for freedom, freedom
We know you can hear our call, ooh oh
We're calling for freedom, fighting for freedom
We know you won’t let us fall, ooh no
We know you're here with us

No more being prisoners in our homes
No more being afraid to talk
Our dream is just to be free, just to be free
Now when we've taking our first step
Towards a life of complete freedom
We can see our dream getting closer and closer, we're almost there

Oh God thank you..
For giving us the strength to hold on
And now we're here together

Calling you for freedom, freedom
We know you can hear our call, ooh oh
We're calling for freedom, fighting for freedom
We know you won’t let us fall, ooh no

I can feel the pride in the air
And it makes me strong to see everyone
Standing together holding hands in unity
Shouting out loud demanding their right for freedom
...This is it and we're not backing of
Oh God we know you hear our call

And we're calling you for freedom, freedom
We know you can hear our call, ooh oh
We're calling for freedom, fighting for freedom
We know you won’t let us fall, ooh no

We're calling you for freedom, freedom
We know you can hear our call, ooh oh
We're calling for freedom, fighting for freedom
We know you won’t let us fall, ooh no
We know you're here with us
