We were given so many prizes 
We changed the desert into oasis 
We built buildings of different lengths and sizes 
And we felt so very satisfied 
We bought and bought 
We couldn't stop buying 
We gave charity to the poor 'cause
We couldn't stand their crying 
We thought we paid our dues 
But in fact to ourselves we're just lying 

Ooh I'm walking with my head lowered in shame from my place 
I'm walking with my head lowered from my race 
Yes it's easy to blame everything on the west 
When in fact all focus should be on ourselves 
I'm walking with my head lowered in shame from my place 
I'm walking with my head lowered from my race 
Yes it's easy to blame everything on the west 
When in fact all focus should be on ourselves

We were told what to buy and we bought 
We went to London, Paris and Costa Del Sol 
We made sure we were seen in the most exclusive shops 
Yes we felt so very satisfied!

We felt our money gave us infinite power 
We forgot to teach our children about history and honor
We didn't have any time to lose 
When we were (were)
So busy feeling so satisfied 

I'm walking with my head lowered in shame from my place
I'm walking with my head lowered from my race 
Yes it's easy to blame everything on the west 
When in fact all focus should be on ourselves 
I'm walking with my head lowered in shame from my place
I'm walking with my head lowered from my race 
Yes it's easy to blame everything on the west 
When in fact all focus should be on ourselves 

We became individuals without a soul
Despite the heat 
Our homes felt so empty and cold 
To fill the emptiness 
We bought and bought 
Maybe all the fancy cars 
And bling will make us feel satisfied 

My dear brother and sister 
It's time to change inside 
Open your eyes 
Don't throw away what's right aside 
Before the day comes 
When there's nowhere to run and hide 
Now ask yourself 'cause Allah's watching you 

Is He satisfied? 
Is Allah satisfied? <i>[3x]</i>

Ooh I'm walking with my head lowered in shame from my place 
I'm walking with my head lowered from my race 
Yes it's easy to blame everything on the west 
When in fact all focus should be on ourselves
I'm walking with my head lowered in shame from my place 
I'm walking with my head lowered from my race 
Yes it's easy to blame everything on the west 
When in fact all focus should be on ourselves (ourselves)
