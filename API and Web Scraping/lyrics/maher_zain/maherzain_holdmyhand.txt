I hear the flowers kind of crying loud
The breeze is sounding sad, oh no
Tell me when did we become so cold and empty inside
Lost our way long time ago
Did we really turn that blind?
We don't see that we keep hurting each other no
All we do is just fight

Now we share the same bright sun
The same round moon
Why don't we share the same love?
Tell me why not
Life is shorter than most had thought

Hold my hand
There are many ways to do it right
Hold my hand
Turn around and see what we've left behind
Hold my hand my friend
We could save the good spirit in me and you
For another chance
And let's pray for the beautiful world
The beautiful world I share with you

Children seem like they've lost their smile
On the new bloody play grounds, oh no
How could we ignore heart breaking crying sounds
And we're still going on like nobody really cares
And we just stopped feeling all the pain we cause
Like it's a daily basic affair
Now we share the same bright sun
The same round moon
Why don't we share the same love?
Tell me why not
Life is shorter than most had thought

Hold my hand
There are many ways to do it right
Hold my hand
Turn around and see what we've left behind
Hold my hand my friend
We could save the good spirit in me and you
For another chance
And let's pray for the beautiful world
The beautiful world I share with you

No matter how far I might be
I'm always going to be your neighbour
There's only one small planet where to be
So I'm always going to be your neighbour
We cannot hide, we can't deny
That we're always going to be neighbours
Your neighbour, my neighbour, we're neighbours

Hold my hand
There are many ways to do it right
Hold my hand
Turn around and see what we've left behind
Hold my hand my friend
We could save the good spirit in me and you
For another chance
And let's pray for the beautiful world
The beautiful world I share with you
