I praise Allah for sending me you, my love
You've found your home, it's here with me
And I'm here with you
Now let me let you know

You've opened my heart
I was always thinking that love was wrong
But everything was changed when you came along
Oh
And there's a couple of words I wanna say

For the rest of my life
I'll be with you
I'll stay by your side
Honest and true
'Til the end of my time
I'll be loving you, loving you

For the rest of my life
Through days and nights
I'll thank Allah
For opening my eyes
Now and forever I—
I'll be there for you

I know it deep in my heart

I feel so blessed when I think of you
And I ask Allah to bless all we do
You're my wife and my friend and my strength
And I pray we're together in Jannah

Finally now I've found myself, I feel so strong
Yes, everything was changed when you came along
Oh
And there's a couple of words I wanna say

For the rest of my life
I'll be with you
I'll stay by your side
Honest and true
'Til the end of my time
I'll be loving you, loving you

For the rest of my life
Through days and nights
I'll thank Allah
For opening my eyes
Now and forever I—
I'll be there for you

I know it deep in my heart

And now that you're here
In front of me I strongly feel love
I strongly feel love
And I have no doubt
And I sing it loud
That I will love you eternally

For the rest of my life
I'll be with you
I'll stay by your side
Honest and true
'Til the end of my time
I'll be loving you, loving you

For the rest of my life
Through days and nights
I'll thank Allah
For opening my eyes
Now and forever I
I'll be there for you

I know it deep in my heart
