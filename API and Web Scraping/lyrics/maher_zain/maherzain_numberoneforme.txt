I was a foolish little child
Crazy things I used to do
And all the pain I put you through
Mama now I'm here for you
For all the times I made you cry
The days I told you lies
Now it's time for you to rise
For all the things you sacrificed

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Oh, if I could turn back time rewind
If I could make it undone
I swear that I would
I would make it up to you
Mum I'm all grown up now
It's a brand new day
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day
Mum I'm all grown up now
And it's not too late
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day

And now I finally understand
Your famous line
About the day I'd face in time
'Cause now I've got a child of mine
And even though I was so bad
I've learned so much from you
Now I'm trying to do it too
Love my kid the way you do

Oh, if I could turn back time rewind
If I could make it undone
I swear that I would
I would make it up to you
Oh, if I could turn back time rewind
If I could make it undone
I swear that I would
I would make it up to you
Mum I'm all grown up now
It's a brand new day
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day
Mum I'm all grown up now
And it's not too late
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day

You know you are the number one for me <i>[x3]</i>
Oh, oh, number one for me 
You know you are the number one for me <i>[x3]</i>
Oh, oh, number one for me 

There's no one in this world that can take your place
Oh, I'm sorry for ever taking you for granted, ooh
I will use every chance I get
To make you smile, whenever I'm around you
Now I will try to love you like you love me
Only God knows how much you mean to me

Oh, if I could turn back time rewind
If I could make it undone
I swear that I would
I would make it up to you
Mum I'm all grown up now
It's a brand new day
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day
Mum I'm all grown up now
And it's not too late
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day
Mum I'm all grown up now
It's a brand new day
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day
Mum I'm all grown up now
And it's not too late
I'd like to put a smile on your face every day

The number one for me <i>[x3]</i>

Oh, oh, number one for me
