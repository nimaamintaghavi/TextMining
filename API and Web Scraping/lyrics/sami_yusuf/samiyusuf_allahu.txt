<i>[Chorus]</i>
Allahu Allahu Allahu
<i>[x8]</i>

Truly He is the One
He has no father or son
Everything in creation was by Him begun
With His infinite power anything could be done
Ask Allah for His Pardon
And you’ll enter the Garden

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Before Him there were none
Of partners He has none
He knows what is apparent and what is hidden
All the fate of creation has already been written
His Will is always done
And can never be undone

<i>[Chorus]</i>

From amongst all humans
Muhammad was chosen
He was illiterate and he was an orphan
Yet Allah sent him to those who were pagans
Oh Allah let us drink
From his hand in the fountain

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Ya Allah You’re the Sovereign
You’re the Sultan of Sultans
Please protect me from Shaytan and all of his treason
Let him not with his whispers my iman ever weaken
My only wish in this life
Is to attain Your Pardon
