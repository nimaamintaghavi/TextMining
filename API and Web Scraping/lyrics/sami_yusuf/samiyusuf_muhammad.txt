Every day I see the same headlines
Crimes committed in the name of the divine
People committing atrocities in his name
They murder and kidnap with no shame
But did he teach hatred, violence, or bloodshed? No… Oh No

He taught us about human brotherhood
And against prejudice he firmly stood
He loved children, their hands he’d hold
And taught his followers to respect the old
So would he allow the murder of an innocent child? Oh No…

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Muhammad ya rasulallah
Muhammad ya habiballah
Muhammad ya khalilallah
Muhammad

Muhammad ya rasulallah
Muhammad ya shafi’allah
Muhammad ya bashirallah
Ya rasulallah

Muhammad the light of my eyes
About you they spread many lies
If only they came to realise
Bloodshed you despise

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
