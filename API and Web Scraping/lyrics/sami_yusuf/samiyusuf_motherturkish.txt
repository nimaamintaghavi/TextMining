Blessed is your face
Blessed is your name
My beloved
Blessed is your smile
Which makes my soul want to fly
My beloved
All the nights
And all the times
That you cared for me
But I never realised it
And now it’s too late
Forgive me

Now I’m alone filled with so much shame
For all the years I caused you pain
If only I could sleep in your arms again
Mother I’m lost without you

You were the sun that brightened my day
Now who’s going to wipe my tears away
If only I knew what I know today
Mother I’m lost without you

<i>[Turkish:]</i>
Ben derdimi kime söyleyeyim
Sensiz ana
Senin kadrini hic bilemedim ben
Aziz ana

Resul buyurdu;
Cennet analarin ayaklari altinda
Senin hayalin aklimda,
ruhumda, ruyalarimda

Sen gittiginde canim gitti,
Ayrilik bir yaman dertti,
Dunya bana cefa etti,
Benim aziz anam

Aglarim ben bulut gibi,
Dilimdesin sarki gibi,
Gunahlarim derin derin
Hakkini helal et ana

To whom will I tell my sorrow
in your absence, mother?
I didn’t know your real value, my beloved mother

The Messenger (pbuh) said
“Paradise is under the mothers’ feet”
Your image is in my heart, my soul, and my dreams

When you left, my soul left
Our separation was painful
The world gave me pain
and sorrow my beloved mother

I cry like a cloud
You are like a song on my tongue
I’ve wronged you countless times
Forgive me mother
