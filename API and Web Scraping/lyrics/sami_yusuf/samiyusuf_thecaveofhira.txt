<i>[Chorus]</i>
Hayya ‘ibad Allah
(Come O servants of Allah)
Ahibba Allah
(O you who love Allah)
Sallu ‘ala an-Nabi
(Send salutations to the Prophet)

On a clear and moonlit night
In the dark cave of Hira
A man began to cry
Oh Allah show me the light
Tell me why I was created
Where will I go after I die?
What’s the purpose of this life
Where people murder and lie?
How can I stop their corruption?
Oh Allah You’re my only Guide.

Ya Habibi ya Mustafa
(O my beloved O Chosen One)
Ya Rasula Allah ya Habiba Allah ya Safiyya Allah
(O Messenger of Allah, O Beloved of Allah,
O Intimate of Allah)

Ya Habibi ya Mustafa
Anta gharami, dhikruk kalami, kulla ayyami
(You are the object of my love,
your remembrance are the only words I speak throughout my days)
On that clear and blessed night
Jibra’il came to Hira
He hugged Prophet Muhammad
Until he thought he would die
Read O Muhammad read
In the name of your Lord
By Allah you’ve been chosen
Over the whole of mankind
You’ve been elevated high
Like the moon up in the sky

<i>[Chorus]</i>

Ya Yasin Ya Khalil Allah
Ya Amin Ya Najiyya Allah
Ya Makin Ya Shahid Allah
Ya Mukhtar Ya Hafiyya Allah
Ya Taha Ya Habiba Allah
(All names of the Prophet (pbuh))

<i>[Chorus]</i>

He’s a mercy for mankind
His speech was gentle and kind
He summoned people to Allah
And led them on his path
Mankind lived in the darkness
Everyone alive was just blind
His message brought the light
To the hearts that had no sight
In mercy he’s the ocean
While others are drops of rain.

Ya Habibi ya Mustafa
Ya Rasula Allah ya habiba Allah ya Safiyya Allah
Ya Habibi ya Mustafa
Anta gharami, dhikruk kalami, kulla ayyami
Forever we’ll be indebted
To him for this Islam
Our life for him we’ll give
His message with us will live
Our love for him knows no bounds
It is loftier than the clouds
Whenever his name is mentioned
Our tears begin to flow
Oh Allah send your blessings
On al Mustafa
Ya Habibi ya Mustafa
Anta gharami, dhikruk kalami, kulla ayyami
Ya Habibi ya Mustafa
Ya Rasula Allah ya Habiba Allah ya Safiyya Allah
Ya Habibi ya Mustafa
Ya Nabiyya Allah, ya Waliyya Allah, ya Khalil Allah
