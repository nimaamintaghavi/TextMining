Let us rejoice indeed
For this is the day of Eid

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
La ilaha illallah
Muhammad rasulallah
La ilaha illallah
Muhammad rasulallah
‘Alayhi salatullah
‘Alayhi salatullah

Children are wearing new clothes
Bright colours fill the streets
Their faces full of laughter
Their pockets full of sweets
Let us rejoice indeed
For this is the day of Eid

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Mosques are full of worshippers
in rows straight and neat
Their Lord they remember, His name they repeat
Their hands are raised to the sky
They supplicate and plead
On this blessed day
Forgive us they entreat
Let us rejoice indeed
For this is the day of Eid

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

People are giving charity
And helping those in need
In giving they’re competing
Today there is no greed
Let us rejoice indeed
For this is the day of Eid

<i>[CHORUS]</i>

Enemies embracing each other
All hatred is buried
Everyone is celebrating
Greeting everyone they meet
Let us rejoice indeed
For this is the day of Eid.
