My ummah, my ummah
He will say
Rasulullah on that day
Even though we've strayed from him and his way
My brothers, my sisters, in Islam
Let's struggle, work, and pray
If we are to
Bring back the glory of his way

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Ya Allah ya rabbal 'alamin
Ya rahmanu ya rahim
Ya rabbi
<i>[O Allah Lord of the Worlds
O Merciful and Beneficent
O my Lord]</i>
Let the Ummah rise again
<i>[x2]</i>
Let us see daylight again
Once again

Let's become whole again
Proud again
'Cause I swear with firm belief in our hearts
We can bring back the glory of our past

My ummah, my ummah
He will say
Rasulullah on that day
Even though we strayed from him and his way
Look at where we were
And look at where we are
And tell me
Is this how he'd want it to be?
Oh no! Let us bring back our glory

<i>[Chorus]</i>
