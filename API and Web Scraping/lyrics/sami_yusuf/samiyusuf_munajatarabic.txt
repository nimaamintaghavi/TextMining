Wahdi fi dhulmati layli, 
Fi wahshati darbi,
Hammi yuthqiluni,
Dhanbi yu’limuni, 
Alone, in the darkness of my night 
In the loneliness of my path 
My worries weigh me down 
My sins pain me 

Wahdi, ad’uka wa arju, 
Min dhanbi ashku,
Mali siwak,
Ana fi himak, 
Alone, I supplicate to You and I hope, 
From my sins I complain,
I have no one but You,
I am at Your door,

<i>[CHORUS:]</i>
Farham ‘abdan najak,
Ya Allah, ya Allah,
Anta alraja, Minka alhuda, 
Ya Allah, ya Allah,
So forgive a servant who intimately calls You 
O Allah, O Allah 
You are all hope,
From You is guidance 
O Allah, O Allah  

Rabbahu hudak, Ma ziltu asir 
Wa’alal ‘isyan. Ma ‘udtu qadir  
Fa’anir durubi, Waghfir dhunubi 
Fa’anal faqir 
O Allah give me your guidance
For I am still imprisoned 
Of disobedience I am no longer capable  
So illuminate my paths and forgive my sins  
For I am poor and in need of You 

Qad ‘adal qalbu, Fiddarbi yasir 
Farihan mushtaqan, Lillahi yatir 
Wa rajahu ridhaka, Yawma liqaka 
Antal qadir  
My heart has returned to walk on the path,
Full of joy and longing, flying to God,
And its only hope is gaining your pleasure, 
On the day of meeting You,
You are the Omnipotent 

<i>[CHORUS]</i>
